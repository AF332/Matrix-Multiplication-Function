# Matrix Multiplication Function

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script titled matrix_multiplication.py, which facilitates the multiplication of two matrices. This script is useful for applications in linear algebra, computer graphics, optimisation problems, and more.

## Features

- Matrix Multiplication: Allows the multiplication of two matrices provided they conform to the rule of matrix multiplication (the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix).
- Error Handling: Checks if matrices are compatible for multiplication and returns an error message if they are not.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Python should be pre-installed on your system to execute the script. This script uses no external libraries, relying only on basic Python features for operations.
